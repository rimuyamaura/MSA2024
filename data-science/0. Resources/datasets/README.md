# Background
Sales forecasting is like having a crystal ball for a companyâ€™s future! Itâ€™s a crucial part of strategic planning, helping businesses decide where to allocate resources, manage finances, keep inventory just right, plan for growth, monitor performance, mitigate risks, and even set prices smartly. Youâ€™re about to dive into this exciting world with a dataset packed with sales data and related info from various companies.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to pick one dataset and develop a model that predicts sales week by week for at least 4 weeks (12 weeks would be awesome!). Think of yourself as a data wizard, conjuring up insights that can shape the future. ðŸŒŸ

## Choose your dataset adventure

For your dataset, you have two options, but you only need to choose *one*:

### [W Store Sales](W%20store%20sales/) 
- `store_sales.csv`: Sales transactions, customer demographics, and product details all in one place.

### [X Store Sales](X%20store%20sales/) 
- `sales.csv`: Sales data and time info â€“ the backbone of your predictions.
- `features.csv`: Detailed store information to enrich your model.
- `stores.csv`: Extra store-related info to give your predictions an edge.


## A Few Notes Before You Begin:
- Only use the provided datasets â€“ theyâ€™re clean, manageable, and ensure a level playing field for everyone.
- These datasets are selected to make sure you can focus on honing your analysis and modeling skills without getting bogged down by data quality issues.
- Using these standardized datasets helps us mark fairly and compare your work across submissions.

Remember, all scenarios and details are purely fictional, and any resemblance to real events, places, or people is purely coincidental. Happy forecasting! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“Š
